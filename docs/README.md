# Introduction

Vue CLI is a full system for rapid Vue.js development, providing:

- Interactive project scaffolding via `@vue/cli`.
- Zero config rapid prototyping via `@vue/cli` + `@vue/cli-service-global`.
- A runtime dependency (`@vue/cli-service`) that is:
  - Upgradeable;
  - Built on top of webpack, with sensible defaults;
  - Configurable via in-project config file;
  - Extensible via plugins
- A rich collection of official plugins integrating the best tools in the frontend ecosystem.

Vue CLI aims to be the standard tooling baseline for the Vue ecosystem. It ensures the various build tools work smoothly together with sensible defaults so you can focus on writing your app instead of spending days wrangling with configurations. At the same time, it still offers the flexibility to tweak the config of each tool without the need for ejecting.
